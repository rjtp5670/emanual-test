<p>The ID is a unique value in the network to identify each DYNAMIXEL with an Instruction Packet.
0~252 (0xFC) values can be used as an ID, and 254(0xFE) is occupied as a broadcast ID. The Broadcast ID(254, 0xFE) can send an Instruction Packet to all connected DYNAMIXEL simultaneously.</p>

<p class="notice"><strong>NOTE</strong> : Please avoid using an identical ID for multiple DYNAMIXEL. You may face communication failure or may not be able to detect DYNAMIXEL with an identical ID.</p>

<p class="notice"><strong>NOTE</strong> : If the Instruction Packet ID is set to the Broadcast ID(0xFE), Status Packets will not be returned for READ and WRITE Instructions. For more details, please refer to the <code>Status Packet</code> section for <a href="#status-packetreturn-packet">Protocol 1.0</a> or <a href="#status-packet">Protocol 2.0</a>.</p>
