<p>Indirect Address and Indirect Data are useful when accessing two remote addresses in the Control Table as sequential addresses. - Sequential addresses increase Instruction Packet efficiency. Addresses that can be defined as Indirect Address is limited to RAM area(Address 64 ~ 661).</p>
<ul>
  <li>If specific address is allocated to Indirect Address, Indirect Address inherits features and properties of the Data from the specific Address.</li>
  <li>Property includes Size(Byte length), value range, and Access property(Read Only, Read/Write).</li>
  <li>For instance, allocating 65(Address of LED) to Indirect Address 1(168), Indirect Data 1(224) can perform exactly same as <a href="#led-" class="popup2">LED(65)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Example 1</code> Allocating Size 1 byte <a href="#led-" class="popup2">LED(65)</a> to Indirect Data 1(224).</p>
<ol>
  <li>Indirect Address 1(168) : change the value to ‘65’ which is the address of LED.</li>
  <li>Set Indirect Data 1(224) to ‘1’ : LED(65) also becomes ‘1’ and LED is turned on.</li>
  <li>Set Indirect Data 1(224) to ‘0’ : LED(65) also becomes ‘0’ and LED is turned off.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>Example 2</code> Allocating Size 4 byte <a href="#goal-position-" class="popup2">Goal Position(116)</a> to Indirect Data 2(225), 4 sequential bytes have to be allocated.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Indirect Address 2(170) : change the value to ‘116’ which is the first address of Goal Position.</li>
  <li>Indirect Address 3(172) : change the value to ‘117’ which is the second address of Goal Position.</li>
  <li>Indirect Address 4(174) : change the value to ‘118’ which is the third address of Goal Position.</li>
  <li>Indirect Address 5(176) : change the value to ‘119’ which is the fourth address of Goal Position.</li>
  <li>Set 4 byte value ‘1,024’ to Indirect Data 2 : Goal Position(116) also becomes ‘1024’ and DYNAMIXEL moves.</li>
</ol>

<p class="notice"><strong>NOTE</strong> : In order to allocate Data in the Control Table longer than 2[byte] to Indirect Address, all address must be allocated to Indirect Address like the above Example 2.</p>

<p class="notice"><strong>NOTE</strong> : Indirect Address 29 ~ 56 and Indirect Data 29 ~ 56 can only be accessed with [Protocol 2.0].</p>
