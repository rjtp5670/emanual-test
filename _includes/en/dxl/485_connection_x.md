## [Communication Circuit](#communication-circuit)
To control the DYNAMIXEL actuators, the main controller needs to convert its UART signals to the half duplex type. The recommended circuit diagram for this is shown below.

The power of DYNAMIXEL is supplied via Pin1(-), Pin2(+).  
(The above circuit is built into DYNAMIXEL's controller only)
