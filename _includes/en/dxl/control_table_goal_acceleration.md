This is Goal Acceleration value.  
It can be used from 0~254(0xFE) and the unit is approximately 8.583 [&deg; / sec<sup>2</sup>].  
When it is set to 0, there is no control over acceleration and moves with the maximum acceleration of the motor.  
When it is set to 254, it becomes 2,180 [&deg; / sec<sup>2</sup>].  
For example, the present speed of DYNAMIXEL is 0, and Goal Acceleration is 10.  
The speed of DYNAMIXEL after 1 second will be 14.3 [RPM].
