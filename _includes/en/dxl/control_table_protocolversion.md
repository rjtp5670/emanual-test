To communicate with DYANMIXEL, it is important to select a proper protocol type.

The following table lists available protocol types compatible with DYNAMIXEL for communication.

Select a desired DYNAMIXEL protocol type according to your application.

{% capture protocol_note_01 %}
**NOTE**

- In case that a RC Protocol type (S.BUS, iBUS, RC-PWM) is set, DYNAMIXEL will switch to DYNAMIXEL Protocol 2.0 on condition that RC protocol is not detected during booting. Therefore, it is possible for DYNAMIXEL to access to its Control Table in using software such as [DYNAMIXEL Wizard 2.0](/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_wizard2/).
- If RC protocol type is detected during the booting and operates as its RC mode, DYNAMIXEL will be automatically **Torque On** status.

#### [DYNAMIXEL Protocol 2.0](#dynamixel-protocol-20)

DYNAMIXEL Protocol 2.0 is a basic communication protocol to communicate between DYNAMIXELs. See [Protocol 2.0] for more detailed information.

#### [S.Bus Protocol](#sbus-protocol)

The S.Bus Protocol is a communication protocol commonly used by Futaba and FrSky RC servo products.

- Multiple DYNAMIXELs, the maximum is 16, can be wired via signal cables. Notice that S.BUS protocol only allows for use **the range of [ID(7)](#id-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2} from 1 to 16**.
- The available range of data transmission is from **0 to 2,047 (11 bits)**.
- If the [Operating Mode(11)](#operating-mode-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2} is **Position Control Mode**, data will be passed to the [Goal Position(116)](#goal-position-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2}.
- If the [Operating Mode(11)](#operating-mode-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2} is **Velocity Mode**, data will be pased to [Goal Velocity(104)](#goal-velocity-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2}. For your understanding, see the next graph of the control reference by the passed data via the protocol.

<img src="/assets/images/dxl/x/xl330_temp/protocol_s_bus_graph.png" width="1100">

**NOTE**: The maximum speed at the Velocity Control Mode relies on its [Velocity Limit(44)](#velocity-limit-{{ passed_model }}{: .popup2}). By configuring [Moving Threshold(24)](#moving-threshold-{{ passed_model }}{: .popup2}), it is possible to set a motionless point, where The [Goal Velocity(104)] is 0.
{: .notice}

#### [iBUS Protocol](#ibus-protocol)

The iBUS Protocol is a communication protocol commonly used by FrSky RC servo products.

- Multiple DYNAMIXELs, the maximum is 14, can be wired via signal cables. Notice that S.BUS protocol only allows for use **the range of [ID(7)](#id-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2} from 1 to 14**.
- The available range of data transmission is from **0 to 16,383 (16 bits)**.
- If the [Operating Mode(11)](#operating-mode-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2} is **Position Control Mode**, data will be passed to the [Goal Position(116)](#goal-position-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2}.
- If the [Operating Mode(11)](#operating-mode-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2} is **Velocity Mode**, data will be pased to [Goal Velocity(104)](#goal-velocity-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2}. For your understanding, see the next graph of the control reference by the passed data via the protocol.

{: .notice}

#### [RC-PWM Protocol](#rc-pwm-protocol)

The RC-PWM Protocol is a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal generally used by RC servo products. Even if it is not possible to wire multiple DYNAMIXELs with a signal cable, this is the most-used protocol to control RC servos. The RC-PWM is the analog data with respect to time as it is the way of transmitting data by proportion of time of signal pulse width.

- If the [Operating Mode(11)](#operating-mode-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2} is **Position Control Mode**, data will be passed to the [Goal Position(116)](#goal-position-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2}.
- If the [Operating Mode(11)](#operating-mode-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2} is **Velocity Mode**, data will be pased to [Goal Velocity(104)](#goal-velocity-{{ passed_model }}){: .popup2}. For your understanding, see the next graph of the control reference by the passed data via the protocol.

Users can select DYNAMIXEL protocol type (1.0 and 2.0).
Even if Protocol 1.0 is selected, Protocol 2.0 Control Table will be used.
It is recommended to use an identical protocol type for multiple DYNAMIXEL.

|   Value    | Protocol Type |                             Compatible DYNAMIXEL                              |
| :--------: | :-----------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|     1      |      1.0      | AX Series, DX Series, RX Series, EX Series, MX Series with Firmware below v39 |
| 2(default) |      2.0      |         MX-28/64/106 with Firmware v39 or above, X Series, PRO Series         |

**WARNING** : To change the Protocol 2.0 to Protocol 1.0, use the [DYNAMIXEL Wizard 2.0] as R+ Manager 2.0 is not compatible with the Protocol 1.0 products.
{: .notice--warning}

**NOTE** : The protocol 2.0 is greatly enhanced from the protocol 1.0. Accessing some of the Control Table area might be denied if protocol 1.0 is selected. This manual complies with protocol 2.0. Please refer to the [Protocol 1.0] and [Protocol 2.0] of e-Manual for more details about the protocol.
