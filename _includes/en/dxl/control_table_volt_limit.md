It is the operation range of voltage.

|Unit|Value Range|Description|
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|About 0.1V|50 ~ 160|5.0 ~ 16.0V|

For example, if the value is 80, the voltage is 8V.
If [Present Voltage(42)] is out of the range, Voltage Range Error Bit (Bit0) of Status Packet is returned as ‘1’ and Alarm is triggered as set in the addresses 17 and 18.

[Present Voltage(42)]: #present-voltage
